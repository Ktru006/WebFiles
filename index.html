    <h4>Course Goals</h4>
    <p>One of my goals in this course is to develop my coding skills in CSS, and to become more knowledgeable in web development as a whole.</p>
    <p>I am very interested and curious to see how a webpage is developed from the foundation up, and how all the design aspects come together from the code.</p>
