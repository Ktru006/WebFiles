    <h1>The Andromeda Galaxy</h1>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p> <strong>The Andromeda Galaxy</strong> is the largest galaxy that is closest to The Milky Way Galaxy. The galaxy is approximately 2.5 million light-years away from our current galaxy. Both the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy formed roughly around the same time.
      The galaxy formed around 10 billion years ago, and was initially discovered in the year 964 by Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, an astronomer from Persia. In 1943, Walter Baade discovered the central star regions. He found two distinct regions where stars were populated. Within the galaxy, there are approximately 460 globuar clusters. These clusters can contain millions of stars.

    <h3>Similarities with the Milky Way Galaxy</h3>
    <p>It was initially thought that the Andromeda Galaxy was up to three times as massive as the Milky Way. However, The Andromeda Galaxy is more or less the same mass as the Milky Way. It is estimated that there are approximately one trillion stars located in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is about double the amount of stars estimated in the Milky Way.
      The Andromeda Galaxy spans across 220,000 light years, compared to the Milky Way's 100,000 light years. It is estimated that in 4 billion years, the two galaxies will collide with each other, causing the two galaxies to merge with one another. Both galaxies are moving towards each other at a rate of 200km per second.
